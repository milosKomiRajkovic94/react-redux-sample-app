Small example React and Redux app just to showcase my knowledge of using both libraries in the same time as well as knowledge in Node.js, SASS and generaly CSS and JavaScript technologies.

## TASK OF EXAMPLE:

Create the functionality of increasing and decreasing numbers by one. Where the layout would be:
1. One label/title above called "Calculation";
2. One container below with two buttons and current state;
3. One red button with text "-" aligned left for decreasing the current state by one;
4. Current state in the middle in the input field which can be changed manually as well, so the starting point would be changed;
5. One green  button with text "+" aligned right for increasing the current state by one;
6. If the user wants he can change the value in the input field manually;
7. If the user wants he can reset the result back to 0 by using the bottom center reset button in the container;

-One version is done by redux that is uncommented and one version is done by changing the state, that is commented.
